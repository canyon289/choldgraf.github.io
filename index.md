# Chris Holdgraf - about me

I work at the intersection of technical development, open communities, scientific research, and education.

I'm the Executive Director of [2i2c - the International Interactive Computing Collaboration](https://2i2c.org), a non-profit dedicated to open source infrastructure for interactive computing in research and education.

You can learn a bit more about what I do on this website.
